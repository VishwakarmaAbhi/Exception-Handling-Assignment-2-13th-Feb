    "In Python, when creating a custom exception, it is important to inherit from the `Exception` class for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency and Integration with Python's Exception Handling Mechanism**:\n",
    "   - The `Exception` class is the base class for all built-in exceptions. By inheriting from it, the custom exception integrates seamlessly with Python's existing exception handling mechanism.\n",
    "   - This allows the custom exception to be caught using generic exception handling blocks (e.g., `except Exception:`), making it easier to manage and handle alongside built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access to Exception Handling Features**:\n",
    "   - Inheriting from the `Exception` class provides access to various methods and attributes that are essential for exception handling, such as the exception message and traceback.\n",
    "   - Custom exceptions can thus benefit from the standard behavior of exceptions, such as string representations and the ability to be raised and caught in try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Readability and Maintenance**:\n",
    "   - Using custom exceptions that inherit from `Exception` improves code readability and maintainability. It makes it clear that the custom class is intended to be used as an exception.\n",
    "   - This helps other developers understand the purpose of the class and how it fits into the error-handling logic of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Specificity in Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - Custom exceptions allow for more specific exception handling. Instead of catching a broad exception, you can catch a specific custom exception, which improves error diagnosis and debugging.\n",
    "   - This specificity allows developers to handle different error conditions in a more granular and controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate creating a custom exception by inheriting from the `Exception` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Custom exception class for specific error conditions.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "def example_function(value):\n",
    "    if value < 0:\n",
    "        raise MyCustomError(\"Value cannot be negative!\")\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = example_function(-1)\n",
    "except MyCustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `MyCustomError` class inherits from the `Exception` class.\n",
    "- When a negative value is passed to `example_function`, a `MyCustomError` is raised.\n",
    "- The custom exception is caught in the `try-except` block, and a specific error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from the `Exception` class, `MyCustomError` gains all the functionalities of a standard Python exception, ensuring it behaves consistently within the exception handling framework of Python."

    "The `ArithmeticError` class is a built-in exception class in Python that serves as a base class for all errors that occur for numeric calculations. This class itself is rarely used directly; instead, its subclasses are used to handle specific arithmetic errors. The main errors defined in the `ArithmeticError` class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when division or modulo by zero takes place.\n",
    "2. `OverflowError`: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be expressed within the range of the data type.\n",
    "3. `FloatingPointError`: Raised when a floating-point operation fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain `ZeroDivisionError` and `OverflowError` with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "\n",
    "This error is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero. For instance, division (`/`), floor division (`//`), and modulo (`%`) operations by zero will raise this exception.\n",

    "### 2. OverflowError\n",
    "\n",

    "### Best Practices for Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Specific Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Catch specific exceptions instead of using a bare `except:` clause. This helps in debugging and ensures that you are handling expected errors appropriately.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Catching Too General Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Avoid catching overly broad exceptions such as `Exception` unless absolutely necessary. This can mask other unexpected issues.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = some_function()\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Finally for Cleanup**\n",
    "   - Use the `finally` block to clean up resources, such as closing files or network connections, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "       # Read and process the file\n",
    "   except IOError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"An I/O error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Else Block**\n",
    "   - The `else` block can be used to execute code that should run only if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 2\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(f\"Result is {result}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Raise Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Define and raise custom exceptions to make your code more readable and to handle domain-specific errors.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   def some_function():\n",
    "       raise CustomError(\"This is a custom error\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       some_function()\n",
    "   except CustomError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Caught a custom error: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Log Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Use logging instead of print statements to log exceptions. This helps in maintaining a record of exceptions that can be reviewed later.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "       logging.error(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Avoid Silent Failures**\n",
    "   - Do not catch exceptions without handling them. This can hide bugs and make it difficult to diagnose issues.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = some_function()\n",
    "   except SomeError:\n",
    "       pass  # Avoid this\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Provide Useful Error Messages**\n",
    "   - When raising or handling exceptions, provide meaningful error messages to help diagnose the problem.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Attempted to divide by zero. Please provide a non-zero divisor.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Document Exception Handling**\n",
    "   - Document the exceptions that your functions can raise and how they are handled. This helps other developers understand the error handling in your code.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def divide(a, b):\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       Divide two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "       :param a: numerator\n",
    "       :param b: denominator\n",
    "       :raises ZeroDivisionError: if b is zero\n",
    "       :return: division result\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       return a / b\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Avoid Using Exceptions for Control Flow**\n",
